/*
 * TransformPipe as an MCP server, so a person can add it to an assistant and convert, save and share
 * documents from a conversation.
 *
 * Two decisions worth stating before the code.
 *
 * The transport is JSON-RPC over a single POST, with no event stream. Every tool here answers from
 * Postgres or Blob in well under a second, so the only thing a stream would buy is progress
 * reporting on work that finishes before it could be reported — and the specification is explicit
 * that answering GET with 405 is a conforming way to say "no stream here".
 *
 * The tools do not reimplement anything: each one calls this app's own public API in process, with
 * the caller's credential forwarded, so a chat and a script get the same answer from the same code.
 * A tool that queried the database directly would be a second implementation of "whose documents
 * are these", and that is the question you least want two answers to.
 */

/**
 * What `from` means to the API, which knows a conversion by the name on its own page.
 *
 * Word is absent on purpose. A .docx is a zip of XML and a tool's arguments are JSON, so the file
 * would have to travel as base64 through the conversation — which an assistant cannot
 * produce from an attachment it only ever sees as extracted text. Word converts in the app and at
 * the API, where a request body can be bytes.
