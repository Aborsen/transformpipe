 * identical text.
 *
 * Rendered in a real browser rather than composed as SVG, because the titles are set in DM Sans
 * with the app's own weights and a text layout engine is the only thing that knows where the lines
 * break. The font is loaded from public/fonts, so this runs offline and produces the same file
 * twice.
 *
 * The motif is the product: three lines of Markdown, the brand caret, the same three as HTML. The
 * accent comes from the tag, so the blog index reads as seven colours rather than one.
