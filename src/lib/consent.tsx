 * What a visitor has allowed, and telling Google's tags about it.
 *
 * `index.html` denies everything before the tag manager loads — that is the half of consent that
 * has to happen before any script runs, and it is why this file can be ordinary React. Nothing is
 * stored in a browser until somebody says yes here, and until then Google's tags write nothing and
 * send cookieless pings at most.
 *
 * Two categories, because there are two. Necessary is the sign-in session and the theme, which are
 * not optional in any useful sense — refusing them means refusing to sign in — and analytics is
 * Google Analytics through the tag manager. There is no advertising category because there is no
 * advertising: `ad_storage` and its two companions stay denied in every branch below, and a switch
 * for something that is always off is a switch that lies about what the site does.
