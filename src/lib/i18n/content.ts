/*
 * The shape of everything the product says, in one type.
 *
 * English is the source: `messages/en/*` is written first, its `ui` object defines the key set, and
 * every other locale has to satisfy the same type. A key added in English and forgotten in German
 * stops the build rather than showing a German reader an English sentence — which is the failure
 * mode of every string table that is checked by hand.
 *
 * Types cannot check everything here. An array of five sections and an array of three both satisfy
 * `Section[]`, so `assertCatalogueShapes` in `catalogues.ts` walks each locale against English —
 * same keys, same array lengths, nothing empty, the same placeholders — and the prerenderer calls
 * it, which puts it inside `npm run build`.
 *
 * What is NOT in here, on purpose:
 *
 *   - the blog's articles. Fifty-six pieces averaging 6,150 words, so 345,000 words in English
 *     alone. They are not strings: an article is a file, and a translation of one is another file
 *     beside it — content/blog/<locale>/<slug>.md, read by `vite-plugin-blog.ts` into a list per
 *     language. So the blog is translated a piece at a time, and every part of the site that shows
 *     articles asks for the language it is drawing in. What a locale does not have, it does not
 *     list, link to, or claim an `hreflang` for.
 *   - the server's copy of the shared-document page, and the OAuth consent page. Both are rendered
 *     by the server for a reader we know nothing about, at an address with no locale in it, so there
 *     is nothing to choose a language from but `Accept-Language` — and guessing wrong on a consent
 *     page is worse than English. The app's own view of a shared document is a different thing: it
 *     is reached at `/open/<token>` by somebody the server sent here to sign in, it is drawn by the
 *     bundle, and its words are in `ui` under `shared.` like every other screen's.
 *   - the API's and the connector's messages. An API answers in one language; ours is English.
