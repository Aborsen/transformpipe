/*
 * Signing in, signing up, and asking for a reset link — one dialog, three views.
 *
 * Three views rather than three routes. Somebody who came here to convert a file is in the middle
 * of doing that: a page navigation loses the document they had open, and a dialog that switches
 * between "sign in" and "sign up" costs them nothing to change their mind in.
 *
 * Google stays on all three because it is the shortest path for anybody who has an account already,
 * and it sits below the form rather than above it: the form is what this dialog exists for now, and
 * the button that leaves the page belongs after the one that does not.
 *
 * What it does not look like, on purpose: a dialog with an envelope in one rounded box and a
 * padlock in the next, a full-width teal button under it and a line offering an account at the
 * bottom. That is the shape every product ships, and it made this one unrecognisable as ours. The
 * chrome here is the app's own — the header's accent hairline across the top, and the same
 * uppercase eyebrow the converter puts over MARKDOWN and PREVIEW, over each field instead of an
 * icon inside it.
 *
 * No password rules are listed. The auth service enforces its own minimum and this app does not
 * know what it is — a list of requirements that disagrees with the server is worse than no list,
 * because it tells somebody their password is fine and then refuses it. What is shown instead is
 * whatever the service says went wrong, in its own words.
