 * It was a flat list of cards, which is what a changelog looks like on its first day and stops
 * being once it is longer than a screen: a reader arrives asking "what changed since I last
 * looked", and a flat list answers that only by making them read every date. Month headings answer
 * it at a glance, and they are the landmark a year navigation can point at.
 *
 * The entries are English and the headings are not: `Intl` puts the month in the reader's
 * language, which costs nothing and is the one part of an entry that translates itself.
