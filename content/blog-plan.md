# The blog, planned: 51 articles at depth

A ledger, not a wish list. Every row is either an article that exists and needs deepening, or one
that does not exist yet and has a search intent nobody else here is answering. The point of writing
it down is that fifty articles without a map become one article rewritten fifty times, which is the
usual way a programme like this fails.

## The shape, measured from the reference pieces

The examples in `~/Downloads/generated_articles` average **4,115 words**. Ours averaged **1,095**
before this began. Matching them means every article carries:

| Part | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| Frontmatter | Exactly `title`, `description`, `date`, `tag`, `keywords`, each a flat `key: value` line — the loader in `src/lib/blog.ts` is a hand-rolled parser, so arrays and nesting break it. Their `tags: [...]` becomes our comma-separated `keywords`; their `category` becomes our `tag` |
| H1 | The primary keyword, in a sentence a person would say |
| TL;DR | Three or four sentences that answer the question for somebody who reads nothing else |
| Intro | Two to four short paragraphs naming the friction, not the product |
| Cheat sheet | One wide table: every tool or option, best for, key capability, price |
| Per-option sections | H3 each, with a pros/cons table, a price line, a features list, and who it is for |
| The honest section | Where the obvious choice fails, and what it costs — the part a vendor's own page leaves out |
| How to choose | Numbered criteria, three to five, each a sentence with a consequence in it |
| Conclusion | One paragraph, linking the conversion the article is about |
| FAQ | Five to seven H3 questions, each answered in two or three sentences, carrying the long tail |

Minimum 4,000 words. Under 3,800 is a failure, not a short piece.

## The rule on facts

The reference pieces quote prices and feature claims for named competitors. Ours do not invent
either, for a plain reason: fifty articles of invented pricing is fifty wrong statements about
living companies, and it is the kind of mistake that outlives the traffic it earns.

- A price appears only where it was checked against the vendor's own page, with the date — Typora
  is $14.99, a one-time purchase, up to three devices, 15-day trial (checked on typora.io,
  8 September 2026).
- Everything else says "free, open source" with the licence, which is verifiable and stable.
- Feature claims stay structural: the language a tool is written in, CLI or GUI, whether it needs
  an install, whether it handles tables, what licence it carries.
- No benchmarks we have not run. No user counts. No version numbers we have not looked up.

## Tags in use

`Converting`, `Syntax`, `Publishing`, `Automation`, `Safety`, `Workflow`, `Code`. A new tag means a
new chip on the blog index, so it needs a reason.

## The 21 that exist and need depth

Slugs stay as they are — they are linked from other articles and indexed by now, and a slug change
is a redirect nobody will remember to write.

## The 30 that do not exist yet

### Head terms, one per conversion

The pages that carry the volume. Comparison-shaped, because that is what "best … converter" wants.

| Slug | Primary keyword |
| --- | --- |
| best-html-to-markdown-converters | best html to markdown converter |
| best-word-to-markdown-converters | convert word to markdown |
| best-csv-to-markdown-converters | csv to markdown table converter |
| best-json-to-markdown-converters | json to markdown converter |
| best-online-document-converters | online document converter |
| best-markdown-editors | best markdown editor |

### How to, per conversion and per place the reader is standing

| Slug | Primary keyword |
| --- | --- |
| convert-markdown-to-html-online | how to convert markdown to html |
| markdown-to-html-in-vs-code | markdown to html vs code |
| convert-html-to-markdown | how to convert html to markdown |

### Alternatives to the named tools

The highest-intent traffic there is: somebody already using a thing, looking for another.

| Slug | Primary keyword |
| --- | --- |
| dillinger-alternatives | dillinger alternative |
| stackedit-alternatives | stackedit alternative |
| typora-alternatives | typora alternative |
| turndown-and-html-to-markdown-libraries | html to markdown library |
| mammoth-js-and-docx-parsers | docx to html javascript |

| --- | --- |
| markdown-footnotes-support | markdown footnotes |
| markdown-escaping | markdown escape characters |
| front-matter-and-what-converters-do-with-it | markdown front matter |
| what-not-to-keep-from-a-docx | docx to markdown formatting lost |
| is-an-online-converter-safe | is markdown converter safe |

### Decision pieces

Lower volume, higher intent, and the ones that link to everything else.

| Slug | Primary keyword |
| --- | --- |
| markdown-vs-html | markdown vs html |
| markdown-vs-docx-for-documentation | markdown vs word documentation |
| self-contained-html-explained | single file html |
| static-site-generator-or-converter | do i need a static site generator |
| converting-documents-with-an-api | document conversion api |
| converting-documents-from-an-assistant | mcp document converter |

## Internal linking

Every article links to the conversion page it is about — `/`, `/html-to-markdown`,
`/word-to-markdown`, `/csv-to-markdown`, `/json-to-markdown` — and to three to five siblings: a
how-to links to its comparison, a comparison links to its how-tos, a syntax piece links to the
conversion that breaks on it. No article is an orphan, and none links to more than five, which is
where a page starts reading as a link farm. A link to a slug that does not exist is a defect, not a
placeholder.

## Added after the plan closed (2026-09-14)

The 56 above shipped as a closed set. Three more went in the same day the app gained the
conversions they are about — `notion-to-markdown`, `confluence-to-markdown` and
`obsidian-to-markdown` did not exist when `markdown-from-notion-obsidian-and-confluence` was
written, so that comparison piece had nowhere to link a reader who wanted the full route
comparison for just one of the three. These three are that: single-conversion, how-to-shaped, each
linking back to the comparison piece and linked from it in both directions.

| Slug | Primary keyword |
| --- | --- |
| convert-notion-export-to-markdown | notion export to markdown |
| convert-confluence-page-to-markdown | confluence to markdown |
| convert-obsidian-vault-to-markdown | obsidian to markdown |

Shorter than the 4,000-word floor set above — each landed at 3,000 to 3,450 words. Real depth
throughout (verified, dated facts: Notion's API rate limit, Confluence's space-admin export
permissions, Obsidian's wikilink-resolution rules), not padding removed to hit a number; a false
"minimum reached" is worse than an honest word count. Worth lengthening later if a specific gap in
one of them turns up — a section that stops short of a natural follow-on question is a better sign
to extend than the word count on its own.
